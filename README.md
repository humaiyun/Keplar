## ❓ About
Keplar is a personal Discord bot project that is constantly expanding. The purpose of this bot is to be a bot for use by my friends and I in our own private Discord servers. With that in mind, this bot was coded assuming it would only be used for private server use. This means the bot has no formal permission handling (e.g. `everyone`, `administrator`, `moderators`, etc.), moderation (e.g. `kick`, `ban`, `remove`, `mute`, etc.), or automated commands (e.g. `auto roles`, `server event logging`, `command disabling`, etc.). 

<strong>Keplar is an ongoing project of mine and it is still under active development at the moment.</strong>

I don't intend to advertise Keplar or get people to add it to their servers, as this is just a project. However, if you want to use Keplar, my recommendation is to download the source code (.zip), or clone the repository to make this a local bot on your computer. Feel free to modify the source code to your liking.

⚠ <strong>Note: </strong>There is a secondary branch, `keplar-old-framework`, which used to be the original main branch (w/ over 120 commits and featured 12+ commands). I do not recommend downloading that since it is on a roughly designed framework. The current `main` branch has a much better framework and is where all active development will be committed to. 

If you end up downloading, cloning, or you simply like this repository, leaving a star ⭐ is much appreciated!
